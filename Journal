In today's class, we explored the basics of databases. We defined some entities and learned how to create a table using Mysql. 
It was intersting to see how the platform automatically creates lines of code for php. I created a database called School_Valentina and a table named students
These classes have been really useful for my IA because they complement what I am learning by myself.
