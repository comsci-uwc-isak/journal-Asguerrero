Thurdsay, 29th August.

In today's class we were introduced to the new dynamics of the class. Dr Ruben gave us an overview of the year.
Later on, we superficially reviewed some of the topics we studied last year, such as logic gates and programming exercises.
Finally, we had a challenged that included understanding a message encripted in Row 13 and learning how to say "we are initiated" in sign language.
