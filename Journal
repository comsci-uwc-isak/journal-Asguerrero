Thrusday, September 12th

In today's class we continued exploring the basics of Web Development and how to use HTML and CSS with the help of WebStorm.
We built a login-app, using two forms to register inputs from the users and two links that lead to additional sections of the WebSite.
One of my main takeaways from this class is that examining the properties of already existing platforms can be a good starting point for WebSite developers.
I also realized, that even though CSS will not be central for the development of the logical aspects of my IA, in order to  build a funcitonal platform
I will need to learn more about properties such as position and margins.
