In today's class, we continued exploring the basics of Web Development and how to use HTML and CSS with the help of WebStorm.
We built the skeleton of an Encryption Tool. Ideally, this app will be able to output an encrypted message, using a key that the user inputs.
As this is the third class we use HTML and CSS I am becoming more familiar with the syntax and procedures of these languages. 
Something important I learn during the class and that I will possibly use for my IA is who to identify variables or items. 
In case of classes = .name Example: div.row 
In case of IDs = #name Example input#converted.column
